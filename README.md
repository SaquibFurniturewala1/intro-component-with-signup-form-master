# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

This is a solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

The Intro Component with Signup Form project is a responsive, modern webpage section that introduces users to a product or service and includes a clean, interactive signup form. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the component not only provides an appealing layout but also incorporates JavaScript for form validation and dynamic user feedback. This ensures users enter valid information before submission, improving user experience and reducing errors. The design is fully responsive, making it accessible and visually engaging across different devices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

I started by structuring the HTML to create a clear layout for the intro component and signup form. Then, I styled the page using CSS to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. After the visual part was set, I added JavaScript to handle form validation, giving users immediate feedback if they enter incorrect or incomplete information. I tested the form thoroughly to make sure errors were caught and the user experience was smooth.

### Built with

 -- HTML5 – For structuring the webpage content
 -- CSS3 – For styling, layout, and responsive design
 -- JavaScript – For form validation and interactive user feedback
 -- Flexbox – For flexible and responsive layout design (if you used them)
 -- Media Queries – To make the design adapt to different screen sizes

### What I learned
I improved my skills in responsive design with CSS and learned how to use JavaScript for real-time form validation and user feedback. This project taught me how to combine good design with interactive functionality for a better user experience.

### Continued development

Next, I plan to enhance the form by adding more advanced validation, such as password strength checks and better accessibility features. I also want to improve the design with animations and optimize performance for faster loading.
